# Hands-on Experiences with MIMIC 2 Data

In these notebooks, you have the opportunity to explore and become familiar with the kinds of clinical data that are recorded and stored in an electronic health record (EHR) also sometimes referred to as an electronic medical record (EMR). The data are taken from the MIMIC 2 demo data set. MIMIC is an example of a data warehouse, where data is aggregated from an EHR into a form more suitable for research. Our current instance is in a MySQL relational database.
